# stabilitas-thresholds
Capstone Project for Galvanize Data Science Immersive in conjunction with Stabilitas

Business Question:
  How can Stabilitas alert customers to likely critical events as quickly as possible?
  
The EDA notebook covers my initial exploratory data analysis. Some of the cells are quite time consuming, but have been 
commented out and replaced with either hard coding or imports from the data/ directory to make things simpler. This EDA
was conducted on a two week sample of data centered around the December 2016 Market Attack in Berlin, Germany. Topics covered
include initial data visualizations, clustering by two methods, and some initial time series analysis.
